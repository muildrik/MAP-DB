Interior contains an ankh motif (broken). The primary legth of the ankh also serves as a channel running up the length of the object. The top of this ankh channel is covered with a lion. His face, main, eyes, nose, ears, and mouth are clearly rendered. The sides of the ankh are not connected to this channel. The lion head is on top of a bar that runs across the width of the object. The channel continues, in rounded form, under the lion and continues into the part beyond the divider. The object is broken here and to the left of the lion when facing him. The object is also broken at the base of the ankh. It is unclear what the original size of the object would have been. It is probably a votive object, serving like an offering table.
